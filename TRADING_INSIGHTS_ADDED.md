## 📊 How to Use These Insights

### **Morning Routine:**
1. **Open Tab 1 (Global View)** → Read insight box first → Identify market regime
2. **Check Tab 2 (Macro)** → Read signals → Confirm recession/expansion/inflation regime
3. **Review specific asset classes** → Use insights to guide decisions
4. **Validate with Tab 6 (Correlations)** → Check if relationships make sense
5. **Execute via Tab 11 (Risk Analytics)** → Size positions based on breadth

### **Example Trade Decision:**

**Scenario:** You see this in the morning:
- Tab 1: Risk-on environment (SPY up, TLT down, USD down)
- Tab 2: Steep yield curve, credit spreads tight, VIX = 12
- Tab 3: EM outperforming US
- Tab 7: Financials and Industrials leading

**Insight Interpretation:**
```
✅ Early cycle expansion confirmed
✅ Risk appetite high
✅ Global growth accelerating
✅ Financials + Industrials = cyclical leadership
```

**Action:**
```
1. Increase equity exposure to 100%+
2. Overweight EM (Tab 3)
3. Overweight Financials/Industrials (Tab 7)
4. Consider small-cap (SIZE) if leading (Tab 8)
5. Monitor breadth (Tab 11) - should be >70%
```
